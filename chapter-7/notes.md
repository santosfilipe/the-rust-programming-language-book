# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

- Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your codeâ€™s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the __module system__, include:

  - *Packages*: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
  - *Crates*: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
  - *Modules* and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
  - *Paths*: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

## Packages and Crates

- *Crate*: A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.

- *Package*: A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those crates.

  -  If a package contains src/main.rs and src/lib.rs, it has two crates: a library and a binary, both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the src/bin directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.
