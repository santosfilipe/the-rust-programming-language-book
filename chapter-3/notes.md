# Notes for Chapter 3

## Variables and Mutability

- As mentioned in Chapter 2, **by default variables are immutable**.

- Constants arenâ€™t just immutable by defaultâ€”theyâ€™re always immutable.

- You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated.

- Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

- The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.

Example of a Rust constant: `const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;`

## Data Types

- Keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

- Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

### Integer

- Signed integer types start with `i`, instead of `u`. Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether itâ€™s possible for the number to be negative.

### Floating-point

- Rustâ€™s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`. Default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

### Boolean

- As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`.

### Character

- Rustâ€™s `char` type is the languageâ€™s most primitive alphabetic type, and the following code shows one way to use it. (Note that `char` literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.)

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'â„¤';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

### Compound Types

- Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### Tuple

- Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size. We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

- To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

- In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

### Array

- Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

- In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

- If youâ€™re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector.

- An example of when you might want to use an array rather than a vector is in a program that needs to know the names of the months of the year. Itâ€™s very unlikely that such a program will need to add or remove months, so you can use an array because you know it will always contain 12 elements.

- You would write an arrayâ€™s type by using square brackets, and within the brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

- An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

## Functions

- Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.

- Rust doesnâ€™t care where you define your functions, only that theyâ€™re defined somewhere.

- Example of a simple function that expects 1 parameter:

```rust
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

- In function signatures, **you must declare the type of each parameter.** This is a deliberate decision in Rustâ€™s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.

- Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We donâ€™t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`).

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

## Control Flow

- You must be explicit and always provide `if` with a Boolean as its condition.

- You can have multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

- Rust only executes the block for the first true condition, and once it finds one, it doesnâ€™t even check the rest.

- Example of a `for` loop iterating over a collection:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

- The safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times:

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
