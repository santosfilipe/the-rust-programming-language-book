# Ownership

- Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways.

- The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out. Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is called popping off the stack.

- The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating.  

- Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory.

## Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
